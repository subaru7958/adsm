## Tips & Best Practices

### For Admins:
- Use consistent opponent naming (e.g., always "Lincoln High" not "Lincoln HS")
- Set location type correctly for accurate home/away tracking
- Create games well in advance so players can see schedule

### For Coaches:
- Submit scores promptly after games
- Use game notes to highlight key moments or player achievements
- Regular attendance tracking still applies to games

### For Players:
- Check schedule regularly for upcoming games
- Orange cards = competitive events (be prepared!)
- Past game scores help track team progress

## Troubleshooting

**Q: I don't see the opponent field**
- A: Make sure "Event Type" is set to Game/Meet/Competition (not Training)

**Q: Coach doesn't see score entry form**
- A: Score form only appears for games/competitions, not training sessions

**Q: Player doesn't see final score**
- A: Coach must submit the score first, and game must be in the past

**Q: Can I change a training session to a game?**
- A: Yes! Edit the session and change the Event Type, then add opponent info

- Event type defaults to "Training" so nothing changes unless you want it to
